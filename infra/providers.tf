# AzureRM Provider Configuration (Terraform)
#############################################
#
# This file configures the Terraform AzureRM provider, including:
# - Authentication inputs (subscription / tenant / client ID)
# - Safety / lifecycle behaviors for certain Azure resource types via `features {}`
#
# Notes on authentication (OIDC / Workload Identity Federation):
# - This repo is set up to support OIDC-based auth (no long-lived secrets) when run from CI.
# - In GitHub Actions + Microsoft Entra Workload Identity Federation, you typically provide:
#   - AZURE_CLIENT_ID (or the app/managed identity client ID)
#   - AZURE_TENANT_ID (directory/tenant ID)
#   - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#   Microsoft Learn: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust-user-assigned-managed-identity#configure-a-federated-identity-credential-on-a-user-assigned-managed-identity
#
# - `subscription_id`, `tenant_id`, `client_id`, and `use_oidc` are wired via Terraform variables so
#   the same configuration can run locally (developer auth) or in CI (OIDC).

    # Key Vault
    #########################################
    # Key Vaults commonly use soft-delete and (optionally) purge protection.
    # - Soft delete retains a deleted vault for a retention period; it can be recovered or purged.
    # - Purge protection prevents purging until retention elapses.

      # In general, Terraform can be configured to purge (permanently delete) a Key Vault when it
      # is destroyed. That behavior is often useful in dev/test environments where you want to
      # quickly reuse globally unique Key Vault names.
      #
      # In this deployment, however, purge behavior is governed by organizational / platform policy,
      # so we do NOT request purging on destroy here. Soft-deleted vaults and name reuse will be
      # subject to those external policies and retention settings.
      purge_soft_delete_on_destroy = false # policy-driven: purging on destroy is disabled here

      # If a vault name already exists in a soft-deleted state (common when names are globally
      # unique and a prior deployment deleted it), attempt to recover it automatically.
      # This helps make `apply` more idempotent in dev/test where environments are recreated.
